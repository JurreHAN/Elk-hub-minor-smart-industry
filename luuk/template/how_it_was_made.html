          <h3>Where it started</h3>
          <p>
            I started the project with my own design and functionality. It looked great, but it was just like the other websites I had built before.
            For this portfolio I wanted something more professional and complex. This is where AI came in. I started exploring how AI could help elevate the project.
            It turned out that AI could change the aesthetics and functionality with a very well. Based on the existing website I prompted the AI to transform my pages into a modern Apple-like design.

          <div class="icon-box"><i class="bi bi-gear"></i></div>
          <h3>How it was to use AI</h3>
          <p>
            At first it looked easy to use AI as a coding assistant to transform my ideas into code. However, it did not come without challenges.
            Many times the code was not usable at all and required multiple attempts to get something functional or looking like I wanted. But with a good prompt and a few tries, Gemini AI was able to generate some code snippets that matched my design vision with a bit of tweaking.
            This took some time but was worth it in the end. However, if I made this portfolio again, I would not have transformed the webiste with AI because it took a lot of time.
          </p>
          <p>
            I learned that knowledge of coding and web design is still essential to guide the AI and evaluate its output effectively. I also learned that fixing some problems manually required way less time than trying to get the AI to do it perfectly.
